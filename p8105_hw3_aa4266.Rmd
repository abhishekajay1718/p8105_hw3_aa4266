#Problem 1

Data import and cleaning

```{r p1_data_import}
brfss_data = 
  p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(resp_id = respid, location_abbr = locationabbr, location_desc = locationdesc) %>% #further manual renaming to appropriate variable names
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  #spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>%  #restructuring the dataset
  #janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  #select(year, location_abbr, location_desc, excellent, very_good, good, fair, poor, everything())
  select(year, location_abbr, location_desc, response, everything())


brfss_data$response = 
  brfss_data$response %>%  
  factor(levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
